# Asynchronous_FIFO
An asynchronous FIFO is a proven design technique to pass multi-bit data across a clock domain crossing. This porject describes one known good method to design an asynchronous FIFO by synchronizing Gray code pointers across the clock domain crossing to determine full and empty conditions.Form more information kindly read the "Report".
